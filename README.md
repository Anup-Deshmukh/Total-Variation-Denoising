* This project implements following Gradient descent algorithms for the problem of total variation image denoising:
 * Simple line-search
 * Armijo line-search
 * Accelerated gradient descent (using Lipschitz constant)
 * Practical accelerated gradient descent
 
This project is done using a Jupyter notebook so that the results can be visualized conveniently. Please refer to the notebook itself for all the details and step by step guidance of the implementation.
